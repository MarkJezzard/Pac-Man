# Pac-Man
Pac-Man implementation in Python

Put the PacMan.zip folder in your Documents folder and double click on it to uncompress it

This creates a PacMac directory (you can now move the PacMan.zip file to the Bin)

Open a web browser and go to https://www.python.org

Then go to “Downloads” and download and install the python environment (i.e., run the .pkg file that should appear on your Desktop to install python)

Once python is successfully installed you can delete the python*.pkg file on your Desktop

On a Mac: Then open a Terminal window (Applications->Utilities->Terminal) and type:

On a PC: Open a cmd window (“run cmd”) and type:

pip install pygame –-pre

[if this doesn't work try "python -m pip install pygame –-pre"]

(this will install the pygame library)

On a Mac, now in the terminal window change directory to the location you have saved your PacMan directory in, e.g:

cd ~/Documents/PacMan

And then type “python3 main.py” or “python main.py” or “py main.py”

The game should launch

On a PC just double click the “main.py” file to launch.
